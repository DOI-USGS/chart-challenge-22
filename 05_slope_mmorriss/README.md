# Comparison - slopeL Glacier decline in Glacier NP since 1966
This subdirectory creates slope chart displaying the percent area loss of the top 10 largest glaciers in Glacier NP since 1966. This uses data from [Fagre et al 2017](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/58af7022e4b01ccd54f9f542). The `.Rmd` file documents initial data exploration steps, and the build of the final plot output. The map of the Grinnell Glacier was created using ArcGIS and added to the plot using a vector design program.
