# Timeseries: downwards / upwards

The code in this directory creates a series of plots that compare the access to Basic Clean Drinking water between rural and urban areas across ~155 countries. The plot is modeled on another 30 day Chart Challenge [post](https://github.com/Pablo-Alvarez-Baeza/30DayChartChallenge/blob/main/30chartchallenge_6_2022_figma.png) looking at life expectancy differences. The code creates a graph to highlight these differences - as opposed to a typical plot.
