# Sources of sediment in North Carolina streams
The chart for Day 8, distributions - mountains shows sediment sources across ecoregions in North Carolina. The chart was made using the `ggridges` package and a `MetBrewer` color scale. Inset maps were made separately with GIS software and added to the final plot using a vector design program.
