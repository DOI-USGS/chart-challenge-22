The amount of flow in rivers in the continental United States varies throughout the year and across the country, but overall where we have gages we see that late winter/early spring months (March - May) tend to have the highest flows and late summer/early fall months tend to have the lowest flows. Extreme events can occur within these long-term ranges, but can also stray outside of them: e.g. extreme low flows in [November 1952](https://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/1804/report.pdf#:~:text=The%20rare%20occurrence%20of%20a%20succession%20of%20drought-,much%20of%20the%20southern%20half%20of%20the%20Nation.) or extreme high flows in [June 1972](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp924).

The Colorado River Basin demonstrates how varied sub-basin flows can be, with wetter conditions driven by snowmelt in the upper part of the basin, and drier conditions influenced more by monsoonal rains in the lower part of the basin. The USGS is currently working to better understand hydrological drought dynamics across the country and recently hosted a stakeholder listening session on [streamflow drought](https://www.drought.gov/webinars/drought-prediction-focus-streamflow-end-user-listening-session). Future listening sessions aimed at engaging a wide range of stakeholders will cover [groundwater drought](https://www.drought.gov/events/drought-prediction-focus-groundwater-end-user-listening-session), water use, ecosystems, and drought prediction.
