At the end of the 2010 decade few streamgages were considered in streamflow drought, but more recently, starting in the summer of 2021    we saw many locations have streamflow decline into drought conditions

In these charts, occurrences of streamflow drought events occurring across 122 different streamgages in the Upper Colorado River Basin are arranged chronologically. The wider the plot grows, the greater number of streamflow drought events are happening simultaneously. (Could include map)

Drought conditions can be determined using different methods. The method used in this analysis is to define a streamflow drought event as a streamflow that is below the 5th percentile of flows that have been observed on that date.

This variable threshold method of determining streamflow drought events can detect periods of abnormally low streamflow at any time of the year â€“ important information for water resource managers.

@USGS is currently working to better understand streamflow drought conditions throughout the Colorado River Basin to build early warning capabilities.
