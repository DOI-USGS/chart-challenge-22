Contribution to USGS Data Science chart challenge

### Chart summary
The Surface Water Ocean Topography (SW0T) satellite (launching November 2022) will estimate river discharge in large rivers throughout the globe. To see SWOT's impact in river discharge estimation in Alaska, we plot the cumulative upstream basin areas of all gaged rivers in Alaska, as well as the expected contribution from SWOT.

A two panel figure showing the a) geographic and b) temporal coverage of discharge observations from USGS gages and the expected contributions of the Surface Water Ocean Topography satellite. Many rivers in Alaska, particularly close to the Arctic are not currently being monitored, and monitoring stations have declined in availability over time. The SWOT satellite mission will dramatically increase the cumulative upstream basin area of rivers with available discharge data, from an approximate 1 million km2 to 1 billion km2.
